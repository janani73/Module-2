## SEB - Program to Calculate the Mean of Three Numbers Using Python


### AIM  
To write a Python program that takes three numbers as input, computes their arithmetic mean, and displays the result.

### ALGORITHM
```
1.Start.
2.Read three numbers from the user and store them in variables a, b, and c.
3.Add the three numbers and store the result in a variable sum_value.
4.Divide sum_value by 3 and store the result in a variable mean_value.
5.Display mean_value on the screen.
6.Stop.
```

### PROGRAM
```
def result(a,b,c):
    mean=(a+b+c)/3
    return mean
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
print("mean is",result(a,b,c))
```
